					<p class="auto-style4">We are a tiny handmade company based 
					in West Yorkshire (we actually make the creams ourselves!) 
					We formulate and make our own skin creams by hand from 
					scratch in small batches using the right amount of science.</p>
					<p class="auto-style4">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="auto-style4">&nbsp;We do not<img alt="formulated by a qualified skin care specialist" height="200" src="images/ridgewood%20graphic%20design%20union(3).png" style="float: right" width="200"> outsource to a factory, which is quite unusual in 
					skin care manufacturing, but this ensures you the highest 
					level of product quality and freshness.</p>
					<p class="auto-style4">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="auto-style4">We also, make sure all raw materials 
					we use to manufacture our products are not tested on animals 
					and are cruelty free, of course! And we would never sell any 
					skin product to customers that we have not tested on our own 
					skin first.</p>
					<p class="auto-style4">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="auto-style4">We are proud that our handmade Not So 
					Balmy skin care range fully complies with all legislation 
					governing the manufacture of cosmetics in the UK and Europe, 
					through the process of being fully laboratory tested and 
					certified.

					<span class="auto-style7">About Johanna</span></p>
					<p class="auto-style4">Why did I decide to formulate a Vegan 
					Skin care range that is Cruelty free and entirely free of 
					animal products? The simple answer is - I am a vegan and a 
					dedicated animal lover! <br><br>&nbsp;I am the face behind Not So 
					Balmy. I am a fully trained professional Holistic beauty 
					therapist, Aromatherapist, masseur and natural cosmetic 
					formulator who likes to take a common sense approach to 
					formulating cosmetics.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The seed for Not So Balmy 
					was planted when I wanted to know what cosmetic 
					manufacturers were putting into the skin care products I was 
					using on my clients.<br><br>Being a professional Holistic 
					therapist and Aromatherapist and being interested in 
					science, natural beauty and cosmetics I realised I could 
					develop my own skin care line as for many years I had been 
					formulating and developing with my mother natural skin care 
					recipes as a hobby, as we both have an interest in natural 
					skin care. From then on I have been hooked, and it has 
					always been a passion. <br>&nbsp;<br>Developing my own skin care 
					line just made sense and seemed to be a natural progression 
					for my business. So, hence Not So Balmy was born. <br>&nbsp;<br></p>
