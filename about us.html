					<h3>About Us</h3>
					<p>We are a tiny handmade company based in West Yorkshire (we actually make the creams ourselves!) We formulate and make our own skin creams by hand from scratch in small batches using the right amount of science. We do not outsource to a factory, which is quite unusual in skin care manufacturing, but this ensures you the highest level of product quality and freshness.</p>
					<p>We also, make sure all raw materials we use to manufacture our products are not tested on animals and are cruelty free, of course! And we would never sell any skin product to customers that we have not tested on our own skin first.</p>
					<p>We are proud that our handmade Not So Balmy skin care range fully complies with all legislation governing the manufacture of cosmetics in the UK and Europe, through the process of being fully laboratory tested and certified.

					<h3>About Clear the Decks Aromatic Cleansing Balm</h3><p>We use lovely 
						<a name="natural_and_organic">natural and organic</a> ingredients in all of our products, which are paraben free. For instance some of the main ingredients in our “Clear the Decks” Aromatic Facial Cleansing Balm include organic, unrefined shea butter, vitamin E, watermelon seed oil, crambe seed oil, Organic Lavender and Geranium essential oil and Oat Silk which contains natural antioxidants, including avenathramides and vitamin E, with 7% lipid oat oil, 1% beta glucan and 17% protein.</p><br><p> Recent studies show that because Oat Beta Glucan is able to penetrate and work its way through the inter-cellular matrix all the way to the lower levels where wrinkles are formed, it showed a significant improvement of wrinkles and their prevention.</p>

<br><p>SUITABLE FOR:  All Skin types / unisex – particularly normal to dry and mature skin.</p> 

<br><p>DIRECTIONS: Remove a pea sized amount from the jar and melt between finger tips. Massage gently into skin using circular movements. Remove with a warm, damp face cloth and rinse thoroughly.</p>
